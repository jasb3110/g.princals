## Proposal 

g.princals is a function designed to address aesthetic issues encountered when using plot.princals of Gifi package[(3)](#reference), which exclusively generates plots using a "graphic" package. g.princals leverages the power of the ggplot2 package, renowned for producing high-quality visuals.



It showed the input table. It's too important to sort data this way.
