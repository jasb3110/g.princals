# $g.princals$

This script offers a method to enhance the visual appearance of plots generated by the PRINCALS function from the Gifi package in R (1)](#references), by building upon the source code of the original plotting function.
Since PRINCALS produces complex outputs that require further processing for effective visualization, the script leverages the ggplot2 package [(2)](#references) to improve both the aesthetics and clarity of the resulting plots.

## Proposal 

The $g.princals$ function is specifically designed to enhance the visual quality of plots generated by the plot.princals function from the Gifi package, which, by default, utilizes base R graphics [(3)](#references).
By leveraging the advanced capabilities of ggplot2—a package well known for its ability to produce high-quality, customizable graphics—g.princals delivers a more refined and visually appealing output.
This function includes options to generate a variety of plots, such as transformation plots, scree plots, loading plots, and biplots for hierarchical categorical variables [(4)](#references).

## Instruction

The g.princals function overrides the default plot function in R to generate customized graphics for objects created by the princals function. Below are the available parameters and their default settings:

- x: An object generated by princals(dataset).
- plot.dim: A numeric vector specifying the dimensions to be plotted. Default is c(1, 2).
- var.subset: Specifies a subset of variables to include. Default is "all".
- max.plot.array: Maximum number of plots per array. Default is 2.
- stepvec: A numeric vector indicating whether to include a step function in the plot (see princals documentation for details). Default is NA.
- col.lines: Color of the lines in the plot. Default is "black".
- main: Title of the plot. By default, it uses the name of the princals object.
- show: Logical or numeric (TRUE/FALSE, T/F, 1/0) indicating whether to display the plots. Default is 1 (TRUE).
- save: Logical or numeric (TRUE/FALSE, T/F, 1/0) indicating whether to save the plots. Default is 1 (TRUE).
- name: A label or name for the princals object. Default is the name of the object.
- units: Units for width and height. Default is "mm".
- width]: Width of the output image. Default is 250mm.
- height: Height of the output image. Default is 250mm.
- res: Resolution of the image in pixels. Default is 300.
- dispersion: Controls the spread of scores in the load plot. Default is 3, which corresponds to mean ± 3 * standard deviation.
- point.size.loadplot: Size of the points in the load plot. Default is 1.
- point.alpha.loadplot: Transparency level (alpha) of the points in the load plot. Default is 0.1.
- language: Language for the plot labels. Options are "English" or "Spanish". Default is "English".
- legend.position: Position of the legend. Options are "none", "left", "right", "bottom", and "top". Default is "right".
- legend.group: Logical or numeric (TRUE/FALSE, T/F, 1/0) indicating whether to display grouped legends. Default is 1 (TRUE).

## R code

Finally, a figure generated by the g.princals function was presented. If the label names are too long, it is recommended to shorten them using acronyms. A supporting script is also attached

           legend.group = 1,
           language = "spanish")#save plots in PNG format

```
## Output
In this section, an R script and corresponding plots created using the g.princals function are presented in Spanish, and group of variables.
